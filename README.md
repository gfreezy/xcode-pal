# XCode Pal

**XCode Pal** is a powerful VS Code extension that bridges the gap between VS Code and Xcode, allowing you to control Xcode directly from your VS Code editor using AppleScript integration.

## Features

### üöÄ Seamless Xcode Integration
- **Build Projects**: Trigger Xcode builds without leaving VS Code
- **Run Projects**: Execute your Xcode projects with a simple keyboard shortcut
- **Open Files**: Open the current file in Xcode with automatic focus switching

### ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Cmd+B` - Build Project in Xcode
- `Ctrl+Cmd+R` - Run Project in Xcode
- `Ctrl+Cmd+X` - Open Current File in Xcode

### üéØ Smart Focus Management
- Build and run operations happen in the background, keeping VS Code in focus
- Opening files in Xcode automatically switches focus to Xcode for immediate editing
- Intelligent AppleScript integration ensures reliable communication

### üìã Command Palette Support
All commands are available through the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`):
- `Xcode Pal: Build Project in Xcode`
- `Xcode Pal: Run Project in Xcode`
- `Xcode Pal: Open Current File in Xcode`

## Requirements

- **macOS**: This extension only works on macOS due to AppleScript dependency
- **Xcode**: Xcode must be installed and accessible
- **VS Code**: Version 1.101.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace
2. Ensure Xcode is installed on your system
3. Grant necessary permissions for VS Code to control other applications (macOS will prompt when first used)

## Usage

### Quick Start
1. Open your iOS/macOS project in VS Code
2. Use the keyboard shortcuts or Command Palette to trigger Xcode operations
3. Your Xcode project will respond accordingly while you stay productive in VS Code

### Permission Setup
When you first use the extension, macOS may ask for permission to allow VS Code to control other applications. This is required for the AppleScript integration to work properly.

## Known Issues

- Requires macOS and Xcode to be installed
- May require accessibility permissions to be granted to VS Code
- Xcode must be running for build/run commands to work (opening files will launch Xcode if needed)
